## Description

A WhatsApp bot built with [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework that uses OpenAI to generate responses to user messages.

### Features

- Receives messages from WhatsApp via webhooks
- Processes messages using OpenAI's GPT models
- Sends AI-generated responses back to the user via WhatsApp
- Configurable through environment variables

## Project setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

2. Configure environment variables:

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the values:

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Required environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `WHATSAPP_API_URL`: The URL of your WhatsApp API service
- `WHATSAPP_API_TOKEN`: Authentication token for the WhatsApp API
- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run (default: 3000)

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start

# watch mode
$ yarn run start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn run test

# e2e tests
$ yarn run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ yarn run test:cov
```

## Usage

### Webhook Setup

To use this bot, you need to configure your WhatsApp API service to send webhook events to this application. The webhook endpoint is:

```
POST /webhooks/:id
```

Where `:id` is an identifier for the webhook (can be any string).

### How It Works

1. When a user sends a message to your WhatsApp number, the WhatsApp API service will send a webhook event to this application.
2. The application will extract the message content and sender information.
3. The message will be sent to OpenAI's API to generate a response.
4. The response will be sent back to the user via the WhatsApp API.

### Customizing the Bot

You can customize the bot's behavior by modifying the `generateAIResponse` method in the `WebhookService` class. For example, you can change the system prompt or the model used for generating responses.
